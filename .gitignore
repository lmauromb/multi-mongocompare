# Output of the go toolchain when building to a directory (e.g., `go build -o out/`)

# Dependency directories (go modules)
# This ignores the downloaded modules, but keeps go.mod and go.sum.
# Modules are typically managed by `go mod download` or `go mod tidy`.
# If you are using vendoring (go mod vendor), uncomment the line below.
# vendor/

# For a more specific approach if you use `go mod vendor` to create a `vendor` directory:
# The `go.mod` and `go.sum` files should *always* be committed.
# vendor/ # Uncomment if you use `go mod vendor` and don't want to commit vendored dependencies
